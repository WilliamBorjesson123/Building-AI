# Project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project is about building a virtual personal assistant for scheduling and task management, using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The assistant will be able to understand and respond to user's inputs, set up reminders and appointments, and make suggestions to optimize their schedule and productivity.


## Background

My idea solves the following problems:

* Difficulty in managing and keeping track of a busy schedule
* Difficulty in remembering and completing tasks on time
* Difficulty in optimizing time usage
* Difficulty in finding a personal assistant that can understand natural language commands
This problem is very common, as many people have busy schedules and find it challenging to keep track of all their tasks and appointments. Personal motivation for this project is to help people to manage their time more efficiently and effectively. This topic is important because it relates to productivity and organization, which are essential for personal and professional success. Additionally, the development of virtual personal assistant is a growing field with many potential applications in various industries.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
